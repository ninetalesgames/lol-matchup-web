    "name": "Aphelios",
    "genericTips": "- Learn his weapon cycle: Aphelios has five weapons, each with unique abilities. Knowing which weapon he currently wields can help you predict his actions.\n- Exploit his lack of mobility: Aphelios has no dash or escape ability. Engage him when his support is absent or when he's overextended.\n- Punish during weak weapon combinations: Aphelios is less threatening when he has certain weapon combos. For instance, when he lacks Calibrum (green) or Gravitum (purple), he's more vulnerable.\n- Avoid clumping in teamfights: His ultimate, Moonlight Vigil, can deal massive AoE damage, especially when combined with Infernum (red). Spread out to minimize its impact.\n- Deny him farm early: Aphelios scales well into the late game. Applying early pressure can delay his power spikes.\n- Coordinate with your team to engage when his key weapons are on cooldown or when he's in a less favorable weapon cycle.\n- Be cautious of his long-range poke with Calibrum and his crowd control with Gravitum. Adjust your positioning accordingly."

Position behind minions to reduce its impact.\n- Avoid predictable movement: Her ultimate, Enchanted Crystal Arrow, is a global stun. Vary your movement patterns to make it harder for her to land.\n- Exploit her lack of mobility: Ashe has no dash or escape ability. Coordinate with your support or jungler to punish her when overextended.\n- Build items that mitigate slows: Items like Mercury's Treads or Quicksilver Sash can help reduce the effectiveness of her crowd control.\n- Engage after she uses Volley: Her W has a cooldown. After she uses it, there's a window to trade without immediate retaliation.\n- Be aware of her Hawkshot (E): It provides vision. Avoid setting up ambushes in areas she can easily scout.\n- In teamfights, prioritize flanking or engaging from angles where her ultimate is less likely to hit multiple targets."

Vision can help track his movements and prevent surprise ganks.\n- Avoid extended trades near his stars: His passive deals consistent damage to nearby enemies. Engage when you can burst him quickly or force him to reposition.\n- Coordinate with your jungler: Ganking Aurelion Sol when his escape abilities are on cooldown increases the chance of a successful kill.\n- Build magic resistance: Items like Banshee's Veil or Mercury's Treads can reduce his burst potential.\n- In teamfights, focus on disrupting his positioning to prevent him from maximizing his passive damage."

Apply pressure to delay his scaling.\n- Engage when his soldiers are on cooldown: Without soldiers, Azir's damage output is significantly reduced.\n- Be cautious of his Shurima Shuffle: Azir can use his E-Q combo to reposition or engage. Maintain vision and be ready to react.\n- Build magic resistance: Items like Banshee's Veil can help mitigate his burst damage.\n- Coordinate with your team to collapse on him when he's overextended or his escape abilities are on cooldown.\n- In teamfights, flank or use crowd control to disrupt his positioning and prevent him from setting up his soldiers effectively."

    "id": "Bard",
    "name": "Bard",
    "genericTips": "- Punish his roams: Bard often leaves lane to collect chimes. Use these opportunities to pressure his ADC or take objectives.\n- Avoid standing near walls: His Q can stun if it hits an enemy and then a wall. Positioning away from walls reduces this threat.\n- Deny his healing shrines: Bard's W provides healing. Destroy them when possible to limit his sustain.\n- Be cautious of his ultimate: Tempered Fate can catch multiple champions. Spread out in teamfights to minimize its impact.\n- Track his chime collection: The more chimes he collects, the stronger his meeps become. Denying him chimes can limit his scaling.\n- Coordinate with your team to engage when Bard is away from lane or his ultimate is on cooldown.\n- Utilize crowd control to interrupt his Magical Journey (E) and prevent escapes or engages."
