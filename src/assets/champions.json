Spread out to minimize its impact.\n- Deny him farm early: Aphelios scales well into the late game. Applying early pressure can delay his power spikes.\n- Coordinate with your team to engage when his key weapons are on cooldown or when he's in a less favorable weapon cycle.\n- Be cautious of his long-range poke with Calibrum and his crowd control with Gravitum.

After she uses it, there's a window to trade without immediate retaliation.\n- Be aware of her Hawkshot (E): It provides vision.
